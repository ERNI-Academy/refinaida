- Basic functionality.
- Basic usability.
- Performance expectations.
- Compliance requirements.
- Scalability.
- Integration with other apps, systems, etc.
- Maintenance or support requirements.

Tools to Use: To achieve this, use any relevant tools you know, including:
- Socratic Questions: To explore and clarify the feature requirements.
